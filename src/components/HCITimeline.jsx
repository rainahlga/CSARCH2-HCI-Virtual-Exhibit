Communication was one-way and heavily delayed: users committed to a whole batch of work before getting any response, worked on the machine's schedule through a human operator, and never touched the computer directly. Because a card cannot be un-punched, one wrong hole ruined the job and meant starting over. Every later era - the command line, the mouse and GUI, touch, and voice - is essentially a response to this pain, steadily shrinking the distance and the delay between a human intention and the computer's answer.",

      `The Datapoint 3300 is one of the first commercially successful video display terminals to replace mechanical teleprinters like the Teletype Model 33, and was manufactured by Computer Terminal Corporation. The directions for operating the Datapoint 3300 were not printed on paper, but were displayed on the screen of a cathode-ray tube. The instructions for using the Datapoint 3300 were not printed out, but instead were shown on the screen of a cathode-ray tube and commands were entered by pressing buttons on a keyboard. This innovation allowed the Command-Line Interaction to be quicker since people could view, edit, and correct their commands before sending it to the computer. The terminal also allowed text-based computing to be more practical and efficient in time-sharing systems, because of features that were not available on traditional teleprinters, such as cursor movement and screen-editing. 
      
      The Datapoint 3300 was a significant part of the Command Line Era, enhancing the way people interacted with computers using text commands. This was different from the earlier systems that used printed output, and allowed for a quiet, interactive screen that the user could type commands on, that could control files and communicate with remote computers in real time. These enhancements enabled the increasing popularity of the Unix operating system and other command-line based operating systems, where the hands-free approach of human-computer interaction relied on a keyboard and terminal. Sharp (1977) found that the use of interactive terminals like the Datapoint 3300 greatly enhanced the productivity of the users by providing feedback during entry of commands, which in turn proved influential in the design of modern command-line terminals and operating systems.`,

      `After the era of command line interfaces, navigation across the display takes too tedious and limited on arrow keys. The inventor of the computer mouse, Douglas Engelbart, created the first prototype to the solution to the problem of limited discrete movement across the screen: the mouse. From a simple wooden block with a button in the 1960s, to the evolved to the rolling ball mouse or the mechanical mouse. The mouse takes any arbitrary three-dimensional direction and maps it to a continuous two-dimensional motion. The algorithm can be described as spatial orientation control is done by treating the orientation of the graphical object the same as the orientation of the ball inside the mouse, wherein the cursor on the display does not matter but the previous and latter positions of the mouse are accounted for.

      Optical mouses implement the same approach of computing displacement through analyzing how light from the light emitting diode (LED) underneath the mouse bounces from the surface back to the mouse. There is a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor that captures said displacement after the off-axis illumination being perceived by the lens. An image is continuously taken and compared to previous images produced before sending it the computer the true displacement of the cursor. `,

The first theorist was Vannevar Bush who envisioned how future information gatherers would use a computer-like device, which he called a “memex”, outfitted with buttons and levers that could access vast amounts of linked data—an idea that anticipated hyperlinking.\n\nBush inspired Douglas Engelbart, a young naval technician, who embarked on a lifelong quest to realize some of those ideas. While working on a U.S. Department of Defense grant, Engelbart formed the Augmentation Research center, devised a set of innovations, and also invented a pointing device, famously known as the “mouse”. These innovations made by Engelbart allowed information to be manipulated in a more flexible, natural manner than the prevalent method of typing one of a limited set of commands.",

    artifactText:
      `Mobile devices wouldn't be that portable if it was not for the ability to interact with a display that acted both as the input and the output. Touchscreens came to life in 1965 by E.A. Johnson at the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern, United Kingdom. Soon, the resistive touchscreen was accidentally discovered by Dr. G. Samuel Hurst in 1970. This specific type of touchscreen allows the user to interact with the machine using pressure. It detects pressure by how much the resistive top and bottom layers conduct. This change in voltage and current tells the machine that the user is interacting with the interface, mapping the location of the interaction and executing the command accordingly. It is cheaper than other types, works with wet and moist environments and can be used by any object that applies pressure on its top layer. For its cons, resistive touchscreens does not support multi-touch, meaning it could only process one input command at a time. 

      Capacitive touchscreens, on the other hand, was invented later in early 2000s that relies on its indium tin oxide top layer, a conductive material when touched by a finger, disrupts the screen's electrostatic field. The interaction is also mapped accordingly by its software to determine what command the user would like to execute. It is relatively more sensitive and responsive than resistive touchscreens, and supports multi-touch. Additionally, it has higher clarity due to the lack of multiple layers resistive screens require. Its named flaws are it does not work with non-conductive objects and is susceptible to electromagnetic interference.

      Infrared touchscreens are used in military grade equipment where it sustains harsh climates with its notable durable. It can detect any type of object touching the screen, though, it is very expensive to manufacture and direct sunlight can interfere with the user's interaction. There are two notable types. Infrared beams are used to sense when a user presses on the interface with its sensors when the finger obstructs the infrared beams. The second type involves internal reflection within the device where the light traveling is divided to travel out of the lens and back into the device. Cameras are used to measure light diffusion when the user interacts with the screen.`,

From Stanford Research Institute (SRI) International, Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer, and Tom Gruber were the minds who pushed Siri to Apple's App Store as a standalone application on February 2011 before Apple bought the assets for $200 million. Being one of its kind, Apple monopolized the voice assistant and integrated it to other Apple products before gradually losing its edge since 2016 when competitors like Amazon's Alexa and Google's Google Assistant were introduced.

      Debuting in October 2011 on the iPhone 4s, Siri was integrated as one of the phone's newest features. Siri came with three initial accents: American, British and Australian. Various voice actors were not aware they became the voices of Siri namely Susan Bennett who voiced the American accent, Karen Jacobsen who voiced the Australian accent, and Jon Briggs, who voiced the first male-voiced version of Siri. Its voiced evolved and the once human voices were replaced with computer-generated speech, or speech synthesis. Through data modelling and developing deep neural networks in cloud computing networks, voice assistants are woken up to life with a keyword like "Hey, Siri".`,

In its early stages, VR becomes a hub of full-body human social interaction in the comfort of our own homes and with animosity. Conversations and interactions become complete and comprehensive when all unconscious body language is involved.`

      "Modern HCI is becoming more conversational and immersive. Instead of only clicking or typing, users can interact with technology in more natural and human-centered ways. Voice assistants allows users to interact with their devices through their voice with a simple keyword, and even control the environment of their own homes and personal spaces. When human interaction becomes inconvenient, scarce and socially stressful, virtual reality provides a safe space behind avatars but retaining the full context of human interaction and conversations through full-body language. Additionally, VR begins to be an essential teaching tool through personal immersion and interaction with the subject when it debuted in metaverse schools.",
